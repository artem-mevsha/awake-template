Wow... the way the world things of light, medium, and dark roasts is changing quickly. **If you've been confused by roast levels recently, it's not just you.**

Before a couple years ago, dark roast coffee reigned king. Drinking “strong” dark roast coffee was the sign of a seasoned, hardened palette. Light roast coffee was usually considered a lower version for the weak tongued. Misinformation was rampant - along with terrible coffee.

But in the new world of *specialty* coffee, things are very different.

**Black as night beans are old news. Light roasts are *in*.**

But why? What changed?

Well, a lot. We'll show you...

* Why modern light roast coffees taste better and better
* The BIG differences between "specialty" roasts (light, medium, dark)
* Why you don't ever want to buy french roast beans again

Let’s dispel a few myths and set some things straight.

Once we’re finished, you’ll be equipped with all the information you need to navigate the new world of specialty coffee roasting.

## Why Are Coffee Roast Levels Changing?!

There’s very little standardization when it comes to coffee roast naming. If you go to the grocery store and grab a light roast off the shelf, those beans will probably be darker than the beans sold by most specialty coffee roasters.

**One roaster’s dark is another’s light. Yeah, it can be quite confusing.**

Here's why it's happening...

* **Coffee bean quality is on the rise.** Farmers are getting better and better, which means coffee beans with exceptional flavors are easier to find.
* **Roasters don't have to hide bad flavors.** Really dark roasts are designed to mask low-quality flavors (like leathery, musty notes), but since coffee quality is on the up-and-up, it's not necessary anymore.
* **Lighter roasts have more complex flavors.** Now that roasters can roast lighter without getting *awful* flavors, they're discovering new ways to highlight [unique, wild flavors](https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/buying-coffee/whats-the-deal-with-fruity-tasting-coffee) in the high-quality beans.

And this means that the scale from *dark -> medium -> light* can move to a lighter area altogether while improving flavor.

So even though it's confusing, it's good... it means coffee is getting better and better tasting!

### But Wait - Which Has The Most Caffeine?

I always grew up hearing that dark roast coffee is “strong” and has the most caffeine. For the most part, this was just a bunch of misinformation and guessing.

**In reality, 50g of dark roast coffee and 50g of light roast coffee have roughly the same amount of caffeine.** Measuring by weight (mass) will give you about the same caffeine every time, regardless of roast level.

However, this caffeine myth does have an understandable origin.

Light roast beans are more dense than dark roast beans, so each individual bean has slightly more caffeine. Dark roasts are less dense, so each bean has slightly less caffeine.

Measuring by scoops (volume) doesn’t take the density of the beans into account like measuring by weight (mass) does, which is where this myth is born. So one scoop of light beans may result in 70 mg of caffeine, while one scoop of dark beans may only produce 65 mg.

As you can see, 5 scoops of a light roast contains slightly caffeine than 5 scoops of a dark roast. It doesn’t have to do anything with the roast level - it’s all in the measurements.
